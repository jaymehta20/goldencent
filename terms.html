				Business Standard will try to process your subscription promptly but
				does not guarantee that your subscription will be activated by any
				specified time. By submitting your payment and other subscription
				details, you are making an offer to us to buy a subscription. Your offer
				will only be accepted by us and a contract formed when we have
				successfully verified your payment details and email address, at which
				point we will provide you with access to your subscription. Business
				Standard reserves the right to reject any offer in its discretion, for
				any or no reason. Business Standard may partner with third party content
				providers to offer bundled services, under which the payment for both
				the services will be collected by Business Standard. Business Standard
				will endeavor to provide a seamless access to all such third parties
				with a single one point access. There could be a gap in this seamless
				access due to a technology breakdown, temporary disconnection of the
				internet connection or any factors beyond the reasonable control of
				Business Standard. In such cases the contract will be formed once the
				access to the partner services are restored. You are requested to read
				through the terms and conditions offered by content partners to Business
				Standard. Most partners offer bundled services for new users. Existing
				subscribers of partners are not eligible for bundled subscription.
				Should you happen to be one please note that the partner will be liable
				to reject your offer to subscribe under the bundled subscription not
				leading to contract formation as a result.
			</p>

			<h3>Payment details:</h3>

			<p>
				When you purchase a subscription, you must provide us with complete and
				accurate payment information. By submitting payment details you promise
				that you are entitled to purchase a subscription using those payment
				details. If we do not receive payment authorization or any authorization
				is subsequently cancelled, we may immediately terminate or suspend your
				access to your subscription. In suspicious circumstances we may contact
				the issuing bank/payment provider and/or law enforcement authorities or
				other appropriate third parties. If you are entitled to a refund under
				these terms and conditions we will credit that refund to the card or
				other payment method you used to submit payment, unless it has expired
				in which case we will contact you. Business Standard will use the
				services of quality third party payment service providers to process
				your payment. Payment options are primarily through credit card.
				Business Standard may offer other payment mechanisms from time to time.

				are not obliged to provide you with a subscription at that price, even
				if we have mistakenly accepted your offer to buy a subscription at that
				price, and we reserve the right to subsequently notify you of any
				pricing error. If we do this, you may cancel the subscription without
				any obligation to us and we will refund you any money you have paid us
				in full, or you may pay the correct price. If you refuse to exercise
