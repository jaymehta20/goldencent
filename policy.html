				several countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom,
				Germany, Singapore, Brazil, India and Australia. Wiley also has service
				providers located in India and the Philippines amongst other countries.
				Such processing may include, among other things, the fulfillment of your
				order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of
				support services. In order to satisfy global reporting requirements,
				Wiley may be required to provide your personal information to Wiley
				affiliates in other countries.
			</p>

			<p>
				By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer,
				storing or processing of your information. We will take all steps
				reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated
				securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and all applicable
				data protection laws.

				European Economic Area. Security

			<p>
				We will use appropriate physical, technical and administrative
				safeguards to protect your data. Access to your personal data will be
				restricted to only those who need to know that information and required
				to perform their job function. In addition, we train our employees about
				the importance of maintaining the confidentiality and security of your
				information. Disclosure in Chat Rooms or Forums
			</p>

			<p>
				You should be aware that identifiable personal information — such as
				your name or e-mail address — that you voluntarily disclose and that is
				accessible to other users (e.g. on social media, forums, bulletin boards
				or in chat areas) could be collected and disclosed by others. Wiley
				cannot take any responsibility for such collection and disclosure.
				Cookies

			<p>
				As is true of most websites, we gather certain information
				automatically. This information may include IP addresses, browser type,
				Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, the files
				viewed on our site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system,
				date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data to analyze trends in the
				aggregate and administer the site.

				Request that we provide you with details of your personal information
				that we process, the purpose for which it is processed, the recipients
				of such information, the existence of any automated decision making
				involving your personal information, and what transfer safeguards we
				have in place; Request that we rectify any errors in your personal
				information; Request that we delete your personal information if our
				continued processing of such information is not justified; Request that
				we transfer your personal information to a third party; Object to
				automated decision-making and profiling based on legitimate interests or

				grounds, such as when the processing is necessary for the performance of
				a contract between us); Object to direct marketing from us; and Object
				to processing for purposes of scientific, historical research and
				statistics.
			</p>

			<p>
				Where applicable under your local laws, we will not use your personal
				information for marketing purposes, nor disclose your information to any
				third parties, unless we have your prior consent, which we will seek
				before collecting your personal information. You can exercise your right
				to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the consent
				forms we use when collecting your personal information. If at any point
				you wish to review or change your preferences you can use the “opt-out”
				or unsubscribe mechanism or other means provided within the
				communications that you receive from us. Note that you may still receive
				transactional communications from Wiley. For queries, please contact our
				customer support center at https://hub.wiley.com/community/support. Some
				territories have national laws requiring a local Data Protection Officer
